# Sinatra and Web Frameworks
## Purpose
- Use Sinatra to build a web application.
- To look at how the various components, from TCP to Rack to WEBrick to Sinatra, relate to each other. 
- In [rb175:my_framework](https://github.com/JoshuaCMorgan/rb175/tree/main/my_framework), we looked at how Rack and WEBrick can be used to form a Rack application.
  - Now, we will put Sinantra into the mix. 
  - (Sinatra essentially is Ruby code that will connect to a TCP server, handle requests and sends back responses all in an HTTP-compliant string format.)
