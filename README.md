# Sinatra and Web Frameworks
## Purpose
- To look at how the various components, from TCP to Rack to WEBrick to Sinatra, relate to each other. 
- In [rb175:my_framework](https://github.com/JoshuaCMorgan/rb175/tree/main/my_framework), we looked at how Rack and WEBrick can be used to form a Rack application.
  - Now, we will put Sinantra into the mix.
